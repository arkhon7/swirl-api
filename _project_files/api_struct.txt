[GET] METHODS

Calculate()
User calculates an expression input.
    A. If the user calculation environment not in cache, fetch environment from db
        1. if environment data exists in db
            1.1 get environment data
                1.1.1 Get the dependencies data from the environment
                    1. convert the dependencies data into a package dataclasses

                1.1.2 Get the macros data from the environment
                    1. convert the macro data into a macro dataclasses

                1.1.3 convert environment data to dataclass and return dataclass

            1.2 add environment dataclass to cache
            1.3 get environment dataclass cache 
            1.4 evaluate expression with the environment dataclass and return result

        2. if environment data does not exist in db
            2.1 add default environment data in db
            2.2 add the environment dataclass into cache
            2.3 get environment dataclass cache
            2.4 evaluate expression with the environment dataclass and return result
        
    
    B. If the user has calculation environment on cache with key
        1. get environment dataclass cache
        2. evaluate expression with the environment dataclass and return result data


search_packages()
User searches for the list of packages based on input.
    A. if packages is none, return none
    B. if there are packages, return an array of packages data
